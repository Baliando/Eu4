<p2>As you can clearly see, something is clearly wrong with this world. There was never a Chen Dynasty in China, The Mongols were never called "Minedanis" and the Mongols never owned all of Siberia and converted to Confucianism, Egypt never had a dynasty called the "Al Daniels" "Daniel" is also a english name, In Arabia and Persia, while there was a Seljuk invasion, they owned all of Persia, not half. the Al Amboutotkum never ruled Arabia or Persia. In Europe, while the Gothic Empire did exist, they were never around during the early medieval period. The Germanic tribes never unified under a ruler, the Rhineland Confederation wasn't formed until Napoleon.

<h5>Minedani Empire</h5>

<p2>From the map you can tell that the Minedani Empire is one of the biggest powers in the world, while they didn't own as much land as the Mongols did, they still own an impressive amount of land, even though that most of it is a cold wasteland.</p2>

<p1>Although the Minedani Empire was extremely powerful, they quickly collapsed due to the constant rebellions they expereinced. After the Minedanis collapsed, what remained of it split into 4 warlords: the Western Minedani, Northern Minedani, Eastern Minedani and the actual Minedani Empire that managed to hold Mongolia and part of Xinjiang.</p1>


<h2>Western Minedani</h2>


<p2>While the other Minedani warlords are footnotes, the Western Minedani are a world power, mostly because unlike the other warlords,their territory isn't in the middle of Siberia. The Western Minedani are also being led by Khan Orlando II Minedani. The only reason I mention this s because thats one of my friends names.</p2>
